Career counselors who are trained experts would help students to understand their strengths and weaknesses and make a career path based on the analysis. They also help students to strategize their learning that matches their career interests. They give students details about how they can build a career based on their interests. The career counselor would also give suggestions to students with the help of which students can choose their careers..</p>

These activities can be sports, discussion, debates, craft classes, fitness programs, etc. These recreation centers are a great opportunity for the students to improve their skill sets. As like-minded students gather in a single space, they get an opportunity to interact and collaborate with students who have similar interests. This fosters a sense of community among the students. These centers are a great way to flourish a student's interest outside the school curriculum.</p>
